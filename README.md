# BankingApp
BankingApp created with Xamarin.Forms and OpenBank Project

# ABOUT 

I am devoloping a mobile banking app to access the API platform OpenBank Project.
This application should be able to authenticate in a safe manner and allow the user to consult their accounts, verifying your available balance and also all your transactions that were made over time, allowing the user to filter and order some of that information. 
Utilizing the functionalities of Xamarin, the app should be compatible with Android, IOS and Windows platforms. For the OpenBank project I will be using version 2.0 of this API REST that is available over here.
Depending on my available time, I may try to accompany the finanacial position of the user with graphical reperesentations to facilitate the understanding of their transactional history.

OpenBank Project 
The Open Bank Project is an open source API for banks that enables account holders to interact with their bank using a wider range of applications and services.
The API uses OAuth 1.0 authentication.

Xamarin.Forms
Xamarin.Forms now comes with Visual Studio. Use the Xamarin.Forms API to quickly build native apps for iOS, Android and Windows completely in C#.
